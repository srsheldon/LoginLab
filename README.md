Todo List:
- [ ] Get Sha-256 or better encryption for server
- [ ] Better Implementation for dialog polyfill
- [ ] Add SCSS support in Webpack (Lowest importance)
- [ ] Design fingerprint registration flow
- [ ] Start researching the Geo Location restriction option for login
- [ ] Add in the voice activated pass phrase option
- [ ] Consider server side rendering
- [ ] Add a framework or leave plain JavaScript?
- [ ] Add tests, including click jacking etc.
